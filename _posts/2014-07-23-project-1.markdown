project_name: Titanic Data Analysis
description: All good data analysis projects begin with trying to answer questions. In this project, I tried to analyse the Titanic survival dataset to answer this list of questions:

1.) Who were the passengers on the Titanic? (Ages,Gender,Class,..etc)
2.) What deck were the passengers on and how does that relate to their class?
3.) Where did the passengers come from?
4.) Who was alone and who was with family?

Digging deeper, tried to analyse the following question:
5.) What factors helped someone survive the sinking?
