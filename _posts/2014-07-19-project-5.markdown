description: The project is on Logistic Regression to perform classification of a data set. It is a data set from a 1974 survey of women by Redbook magazine. Married women were asked if they have had extramarital affairs. The focus is on binary classification to have two outputs, a positive and negative, (1 or 0).The approach on this classification problem was asking the question: Given certain variables for each woman, can we classify them as either having particpated in an affair, or not participated in an affair?
